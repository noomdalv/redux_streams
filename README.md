## Stream Service App

This application allows users to sign in with their google account and create/edit/delete and view live streams.  
It implements a RESTFul API with JSONServer, a RTMP Server to facilitate the connection with [flv.js](https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/), allowing easy stream configurations through web hooks and flash video player.  
The application was tested using OBS(Open Broadcaster Software).  
Users are able to create and setup an easy stream connection with the RTMP server by using the stream id as the stream key.  
<b>Example</b>
```
rtmp://localhost/live/:id
```
