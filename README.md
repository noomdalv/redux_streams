## Stream Service App

This application allows users to sign in with their google account and create/edit/delete and view live streams.
It implements redux, applying async functionality with redux-thunk and route handling based on RESTful architecture.
The user is able to create a stream and setup an easy connection through the RTMP server by using his stream id as the stream key.
The application was tested using OBS(Open Broadcaster Software).
